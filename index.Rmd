# Introduction

This acts as a repository for some of my favourite video talks from the recent [useR2016 conference](http://user2016.org/) along with the ability to view any of the offerings via a clickable table.

It is probably not the most effective of presentation but is a trial run for creating and deploying interactive books to [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/)


## Author {-}
[Andrew Clark](http://www.twitter.com/pssguy) is an independent R developer based in North Vancouver
He has for many years supplied statistical sports data on the web but with the interactive opportunities arising from the shiny framework and the ability to swiftly create interesting visualizations via dashboards has branched out into many different areas. Introductions to his work can be found under the
[mytinyshinys umbrella](https://mytinyshinys.shinyapps.io/dashboard/) and a set of recent [flexdashboards](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/aclark/flexDashBoard/)
